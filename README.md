<h4>Project Details</h4>

<p>RepuTable is a database of restaurants and bars in London that pay their employees a Living Wage and are Equal Opportunity employers. To be listed on the app, owners are required to upload a photograph of their Living Wage certificate. Moderators on the app can accept or send back applications to owners with a message. Super-moderators can change the role of any other user to moderator and vice-versa and also delete users. Any user that has signed up can search the database on the home feed, leave reviews for any approved establishment and list all the reviews they have posted.</p>
